## What is it?

If you've watched the show **Criminal**, you'd know that there's a clock on the viewing room wall.

The clock basically has 60 LEDs in a circle representing seconds. Inside that circle, there are four 7-segment display
shapes all made of individual LEDs.

It looks like this:

This project is basically that clock as a web app. Or site. Whatever you want to call it.

## Why?

Because I love that clock since the first time I saw it. It's a digital clock with a twist.

It shares the first place in my clocks list, which consists of 3 entries anyway, with the
[TIX clock](https://duckduckgo.com?q=tix+clock) and the ones that are made with [Nixie tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixie_tube).
And let me tell you, I love me some Nixie tubes.
